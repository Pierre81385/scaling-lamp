- `Create an account`
- `Login or logout of the application`
- `Browse the list of avialble products availible to purchase`
- `Add products to their cart` (in progress, cart page needed but products track adding to cart in local storage)
- `When logged in the user can see the list of the items they've purchased in the past` (in progress, need to send purchase products to DB linked to userId)
- `CREATE new users and add products`
- `READ database and display products and user details`
- `UPDATE product and user accounts` (in progress, would like to add send email password reset request)
- `DELETE products and user accounts`

# TODO List

- `When only two products are purchased, product cards overlap on My Cart display`
- `"My Cart" page needs to add option to RESET cart OR PURCHASE (commit to database as an order)`
- `Confirm user choice before proceeding needed at Logout button, Delete Product button, and Delete User button`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
